# House Sale Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house sale prices based on various features like location, size, number of rooms, and other factors. Using a dataset of historical housing sales, the project builds and evaluates models to estimate the price of a house, providing valuable insights for real estate analysis and decision-making.

The project includes data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation. The goal is to create an accurate and efficient model capable of predicting house prices for unseen data.
